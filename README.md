# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship Program
This program is designed to help gain practical insight into the daily work done at KPMG. I learn what it’s like to produce business results with the KPMG data analytics team and build the skills required to excel as an analytics consultant.
In this repository, I upload the work that I have completed to complete the program.

# Overview
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organization, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team.
 Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data.
The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but its team is unsure how to effectively analyze it to help optimize its marketing strategy. 
# Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

- Customer Demographic
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data in the past 3 months
  
I assessed the quality of the data and identified ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data in an email.

# Task 2: Data Insights
Target high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

- Build a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the approach I will be taking.
- The client has agreed on a 3-week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.
- Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and reporting

# Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
Using visualizations to present insights: I developed a visualization using Tableau that displays the data summary and results of the analysis. 
Some information kept in a business context when presenting my findings were:

- What are the trends in the underlying data?
- Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
- What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?
- What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?
